title: Goodbye Arizona, Hello Chicago!!
---

##0.0 - The Decision
Moving to Chicago was something in the back of my mind starting back since June of 2012. Never took it that serious till a tech friend of mine raved about the start ups in the area. I so impressed by the work he was doing and at the pace he was doing it that i naturally began to wonder, "how can I get myself better updated to keep up with the tech trend?". 

Around the same time, Motorola, now owned by Google, decided to bring all employees to the Merchandise [Mart in downtown Chicago](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-26/business/chi-motorola-mobility-leaving-libertyville-for-downtown-chicago-20120726_1_motorola-mobility-kevin-willer-lightbank).  I figured, if not now, when?  When will I be able to easily relocate, with a job, to a new city?  Everything seemed to fall into place and the decision to leave Arizona came rather easy.s

##0.2 - The Move
The actual move to Chicago came quicker than expected.  I was hoping to catch up with some friends and say my final farewells to others but circumstances allowed us to move earlier than expected and I took it!  Which meant finalizing my house situation, canceling bills, changing my address, finding a u-haul and car transporter and of course the painful process of packing all your belongings into boxes!! What a pain. 

But with the help of friends, we were able to fit all of our shit into one 17 foot U-Haul truck and stuff as much as possible into my Lexus and mount it on a car transporter attached to the truck.  

##0.3 - The Drive
So the plan was to leave early thursday morning but with all that packing, we barely left Gilbert till about 3PM.  We followed Google maps, thinking it would give us the best route to Albuquerque but we were wrong!  **A complete fail.**  The phone gave use the shortest route, however it did not take into account i was trucking it with a mount attached. I should of known to look at the route beforehand but I didn't use my best judgment and followed the directions blindly through narrow streets all the way up to Payson. Getting to Payson, we took even more narrow and uphill routes to Show Low which was murder.  That had to be the worst driving experience in my life.  First, it started to snow miserably.  We literally had to drive at 30 mph for about 4 hours in a two lane road where the snow made it impossible to even see the lanes. Cars were sliding, trucks were flying by.. uhg.. **just miserable!**  Luckily, we made it through the snow storm and arrived at Holbrook, AZ at 1AM.  The plan was to get to TX the first night but we didn't even get out of Arizona.  

The next day we got an earlier start.  We figured we should be able to reach Oklahoma earlier to relax a bit before heading to St Louis.  **#Fail**.  Seems like the same snow storm passed our route and completely wiped highway 40.  So again, we were forced to traffic all the way to NM basically chasing the storm, hoping not to catch up to it.  We got to Santa Rosa at about 8PM.  At that point I was tired, hungry, cold, pissed at traffic, pissed at the weather.. pissed that I kept having to refuel..the driving was definitely getting to me.  

Thankfully we made to Amarillo TX about midnight and found a complete shit hole place.  Our choices were limited because of our dog but we made due. What i'll remember most is the crazy wind happening around that time we arrived and the receptionist telling me that breakfast is served from 6-9AM, me asking whats on the menu and her telling me "free coffee".   Showered, ate and slept.  The plan was to get the heck out of there as soon as possible and hit the road to St. Louis.

The road to St. Louis was not that bad.  Found it funny, and had to stop at a town called Erick.  Made a few other stops along the way.  Avoided all of the **Kum and Gos** shops and made it to St. Louis saturday night and decided to dine myself at the Hilton for our last day on the road.  I think even my dog appreciated that.  She got to sleep in a huge king sized bed.  Next morning, we ate a true complimentary breakfast and we were off to Vernon Hills IL.

The final leg again was not that bad.  I did notice that my hands were beginning to get numb and I was beginning to get soreness around the palms.  But i just brushed it off as i knew we were close to the finish line.   A few hours later, we were home at the AMLI Museum Gardens in Vernon Hills IL.  Or at least I thought we were home!
