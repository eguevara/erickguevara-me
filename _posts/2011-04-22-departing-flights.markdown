<p>So the day is finally here.  Fortunately no bumps no surprises and no headaches. Everything so far is smooth as can be. Spent most of running around but for the most part I think I have all covered.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all those people who gave me small traveling tips.  Made a difference.  Even my barber who I didn't even know spoke English was giving me pointers on Europe today.  </p>
<p>Was able to get pass security without much issue.  I guess they are against Swiss knifes here.  I thought someone told me less than four inches was cool.  Guess not.  </p>
<p>Didn't have to check any of my bags either which makes me think I packed way too light.  </p>
<p>Also.. is it me or is Euro money look and feel like monopoly money.. Felt like I was getting short changed when I converted my mula..  it is what it is.</p>
<p>More to come.. flying to Manchester soon to watch Manchester united vs. Everton.</p>
<p>Excited ..</p>

So some random thoughts.. on the movie taken and hostel just hit me.  Hope on neither but I'm ready to Liam Nielson someone.  

On second thought. Security took my 3 inch Swiss so ima be Leslie nielson instead . Ha.
