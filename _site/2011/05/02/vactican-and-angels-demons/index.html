		<p>Arriving to Rome went smoothly.  I've finally got this process of checking on lock.</p>

<p>Don't remember the flight to Rome as I slept right through take off.  The airport in Rome was small not nearly as crowded as any of my previous cities. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: This airport was pretty old school. When you get off the plane you are actually outside and then have to walk into the terminal. It was like a scene out an old movie.</span></p>

<p>First thing to learn is again the exit translation <span style="color:#0000ff;">(our new obsession)</span>.</p>

<p>Uscito = sortie = way out = exit</p>

<p>Second thing to translate is,  do u take credit.  I tried saying credito,creditii, casho... all combination.  They just looked at me funny.  One even tried to bring me a coca cola.  What I learned is that if they take credit then its usually on the window.  Or just show them the card. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: I now know that this is how you ask... Accettate carte di credito? [aht-cheht-TAH-teh KAHR-teh dee kreh-DEE-toh?] And you have to say it like you sound pissed off LOL.</span></p>

<p>The other thing to learn is asking where the restrooms are .  You have to ask for toilets instead of restrooms.  One lady said to me we have no bedrooms in here..  haha.</p>

<p>From there.. smooth sailing.  The metro was not nearly as complicated as Paris.  One metro two lines.</p>

<p>Definitely a different vibe in Rome.  seemed to be much more relaxed ..no one in a rush to get out.  Maybe it was because it was a smaller airport..definitely down a couple of notches in the get out of my way type of mentality from Paris and London.</p>

<p>On our way to the terminal I noticed that just about everywhere i looked there was a picture of the late john paul II.  I mean he was everywhere.  Street posts..Brochures .. on buses..I was beginning to think that Italians were having a tough time letting go.  It was close to six years since he passed and I just couldn't believe how still he was publicly  beloved.</p>

<p>Come to find out that this weekend of all weekends the late Pope starts his beatificazione at the Vatican. There are expecting close to 2 million people.  This starts his long process of becoming a saint. Something they said is a once in a life time experience and we were right in the middle of it.</p>

<p>We walked around St Peters square Saturday morning in the rain and it was just straight bananas.  People were flocking from everywhere.  Buses upon buses of priests, nuns, students.  We flags from all over.  Especially from Poland, the popes home town.  There was tons of jp2 paisas. Media was in every corner.</p>

<p>Its crazy to think we were there. Right on the middle of things. We took pictures of the square empty, then of it getting packed.  We also went to the vigil near Circo Massimo which is the size of about 4 or 5 football fields long and that was completely packed with a line of people still trying to get in and a ton of people just surrounding the entire Circo.  Just crazy. We didn't even try, we just took some shots and bounced. Pretty crazy but I'm glad I was able to be part of it.</p>

<p>So anyway back to day 1...after check in we jumped on a bus tour that took us to the main attractions.  We were trying to save our legs and not make the same mistake we did in Paris where we walked all two days nonstop.  Instead we just sat back took pictures and listened to audio guide.</p>

<p>Btw audio tours are the bomb.  We took the audio tour at the Louvre and completely enjoyed the service.  For me worth the extra euro... especially since u can stop and replay the details.</p>

<p>The first day we didn't do much other then rest <span style="color:#0000ff;">(Stephanie: rest = not walking as much not sleeping!)</span> and really scope out the areas we planned to visit. Then came the the angels and demons tour on day 2.  Hands down the best tour so far.  Maybe because I'm a Dan brown fanatic but also because the guide <span style="color:#0000ff;">(Stephanie: We think his name was Massimo)</span> was really passionate about Rome history.  He was simply incredible.</p>

<p>For those of you who never read browns book, I highly recommend it. Definitely one of my favorite books and a decent  precursor to learning some important places in Rome... emphasis on some. The movie is ok... definitely not as good as the book and after taking the tour..the movie is surely gonna be  on my  Netflix queue.</p>

<p>The tour took us through each of the paths of Illumination.  He explained the facts and pointed out the fiction. His goal was to use the book as a guide to explain the true meaning and also mainly to burst everyone's bubble the the book was truly fictional.  He called it poetic license.</p>

<p>Places we went: Santa Maria del Popolo Church where we were able to see the chapels (chapels are actually tombs within the churches), we went to St. Peter's Square and found the putti angel that was blowing wind to the west, St. Maria della Vittoria Church and saw the sculpture "The Extacy of Saint Teresa by Bernini,  we then went Piazza Navona and got to see the fountain of the 4 rivers,
- Castel Sant’Angelo
- “Il Passetto” (from outside)</p>

<p>Some interesting facts.</p>

<p>By law the Vatican is the tallest structure in Rome.  Not one skyscraper.</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Vatican City is it's own country and it's the only country that doesn't require a passport.</span></p>

<p>Vatican as we know it was built on top of what was called Vatican hill by niro and was occupied by pagans.   Christianity was actually illegal then.</p>

<p>Niro, a pagan emperor, ironically with his execution of Peter brought Christianity to Rome.</p>

<p>Niro had wifes and husbands and bathed publicly in Vatican hill</p>

<p>There are close to 714 churches around Rome. The reason these churches were built was to purified the area of demons.  Most of which were built on top of pagan temples.</p>

<p>After the angels and demons movie the Vatican covered the 4 alters from the public.  One is still covered.</p>

<p>Again.  Hands down the best tour and highly recommend reading the book.</p>

<p>Later that day we made it through the Colosseo (The Colosseum).  It was near closing so not as packed as expected.  Took some awesome pictures.  Reminded me of the movie gladiator.  Them Rome people really went out of their way for entertainment.</p>

<p>The Pantheon was incredible.  It just sneaks up on you. It's the oldest structure of worship still standing<span style="color:#0000ff;"> and is still functional</span>. That entire area is awesome because each corner is a surprise.  We ran into Fontana di Trevino by accident and took some crazy pictures and took my cousins advise and splurged on some gelatos.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Stephanie: Gelati was the bomb! I recommend the pistachio.</span></p>

<p>Again because these structures can't stand larger than the Vatican..a lot of them are hidden until you run into them on accident or are actually looking for them from the map.</p>

<p>The food was just incredible. My favorite was spaghetti carbonara. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: My favorite was everything else but the Carbanara. There is just something not right about eating spaghetti with eggs in it. </span> The food part will get a post if its own.</p>

<p>Day 3.  The Vatican tour. Was pretty excited about this tour especially with all the madness going on.  We've already been there twice to take take pictures but this was suppose to take us inside the walls and through the museum to see the infamous Sistine chapel.  But because of the event they closed off the basilica to the public.  So the only really interesting part was the chapel design by Michelangelo.  The other disappointing part was that our guide really sucked.  He was so nonchalant about everything and he really didn't know much other than what he had planned to talk about.  Pretty disappointed. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: If you go and your guide is named Graham feel free to request to be switched to a different group. This guy was full of corny jokes and when you asked questions out his range, his response is... I didn't learn about that OR I don't know I have seen that before. Not cool.</span></p>

<p>The bright part of the tour was definitely the Sistine.   We were actually treated to walk in when the overhead lights were turned on which never happens. Tried to get the tour guide to explain each section but again he just gave me the two sentence cliff note and walked away.  He was horrible.   Too bad no picture were allowed.</p>

<p>The sections I remember.</p>

<p>The last judgment,  Noah's drunken state, Noah's arch, God created man, garden of Eden, god's creation of sun and moon..?? The rest ill have to look up.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Stephanie: The scenes are Noah's drunken state, the flood, noah's sacrifice, the creation of adam, then creation of eve, then temptation, separation of land and water, god's creation of sun and moon and I think earth, then the separation of land and darkness.</span></p>

<p>One last piece.</p>

<p>While in san pietro we went south to trastevere for food.  Didn't know what to expect other than a 20 minute walk along the the river.  What we found was amazing.  So many of these small restaurants. Old styled streets.  People out..pizza shops. Gelato shops. Bars..markets.. Just beautiful.. I wished we would of came soon to this part of Rome.</p>

<p>We also followed the crowd to run into a pretty old church called Santa Maria in Trastevere.. just amazing..</p>

<p>Aight..nuff said..  "tomorrow, we go home!" <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: &lt;-- Said like Mr. Miyagi!</span></p>
