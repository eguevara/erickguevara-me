  <div class="postcontent">
    Arrived to Paris at 9am.  Huge difference when riding first class compared to coach.  The eurostar took about three hours to get to Paris.  The plan was to take some good scenery pictures of what's on the way but I was out.  Those three hours of sleep were golden.

Initial impressions of Paris.

Definitely more of a metro city.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just comparing it to my impressions of Manchester and London.

The locals seem to be a bit more fiesty. they seem to be a second away from cursing you out. Everyone is either smoking or lighting a cigarette for someone that does smoke. Actually if there was a city that smelled it definitely was Paris.

Lessons learned

Sortie = way out = exit.

The metro was a bit confusing at first.  Had no idea where I was or where to go.  What I did know was that we had a bike tour in one hour by the the effiel tower.

Purchased the Paris pass for access to both the metro and rer for two days.  Finally made sense of the metro map to get on the right line with some help of course from the information Booth.

Ehh..the bike tour was good<span style="color:#0000ff;"> (Stephanie: but guide wasn't all that great. She was too busy trying to crack jokes)</span>.  I was just too tired to really appreciate the listening part.  I was off taking pictures of anything.  I think the most important part of these tours is how friendly the staff is.  They totally helped us getting around Paris and answered every question.  If you can ride a bike and are not afraid of heavy traffic, then I strongly recommend <cite><strong>fattire</strong>bike<strong>tours</strong>.com</cite>. its a great way to start off exploring the city.  They even helped with planning what to see and what not.

The tour ended about 4 hours later and the plan was to check in to the hostel and crash to get re-energized but no luck.

I think it was the fact that we were in Paris that motivated us to head right back out. As tired as my body was I just couldn't sleep.

The hostel was ok.  Can't complain.  It was actually in market type of area which was cool.  Not to far from mulan rouge..and right down the block from the metro which made it very convenient to get around.

After walking around the market and running across a few strip bars we made our way to Notre Dame.  Can't say that all went smoothly because we took the metro to the opposite direction and wound up on the outskirts of Paris <span style="color:#0000ff;">(Stephanie: If you ever take the metro to the Le Bourget stop... you are no longer in Paris sweetie!)</span>.  Kinda got the feeling we were going the wrong way as soon as all we saw nothing but graffiti on the wall.  you can't definitely tell you were leaving the city.  Can't say that I was scurrred getting out of the station but definitely had to more aware of my surroundings.  To make it worse there was no info booths for help or even people that spoke English.  We kinda of just guessed and motioned someone to nod for Paris.  Thankfully we got back to the city heading towards norte  Dame.

Ill let the pictures speak for themselves but Dame!

The church apparently is on an island with an awesome walk way next to the water.  As tired as we were we saw boat tours avail.  So we took the 1030 boat tour that took us all the way to the Eiffel tower!

Deferring the details of boat tour for our pictures we made back to the hostel just before 1 am.

Btw.  Its great to speak Spanish. We again found many locals and travel mates that spoke Spanish. Made traveling much more comfortable.  Actually the Spanish speaking locals in all Manchester London and Paris were awesome. They went completely out of their way to help us get the most out of their city.

Also its great to meet good old Americans on route too.  Met alot of people from Texas and Cali.  I guess its like the feeling of meeting an Ecuadorian in Arizona.  Its not often but when u meet its that immediate connection that is refreshing.

Oo on the way home we had a bomb chicken curry kebab.  Slamming!

Tomorrow up earlier to get all of Paris before leaving to Rome for four final days.

Day two.

Started the morning at 7am in the morning from a 5 hour sleep.  The plan was to hit up as much as possible and save the Louvre for last since it was opened till 10 pm.

This day had to be the longest day of the trip.  Its all walking from morning at 7am till about 1am.

Took a revolutionary tour that talked a lot about the uprising and how the city was built.  Talked about the king and queen and how they were executed.

An interesting story was how back in the day class was determined by the size of your calf muscle.  The bigger the muscle the higher class you were. According to the king, your calf muscle was built on protein.  Protein that was consumed by eating meat.  Only the wealthy ate meat.  The poor ate bread and even the cost of the bread would be a months wage. This why you see many portraits of French kings with their legs turned outwards showing their calf's..

Finally to the Louvre.

We didn't get there till about 730 pm. We followed the recommendations of our tour guides and entered through the side entrances. Zero line wait.

Because of time we only took the masterpiece tour.  This only highlighted the top four pieces including the Mona Lisa
Plus we got the audio tour which was worth it.  <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: If you do the audio tour, take advantage of the explanations they provide for most paintings. They have this option where you can enter the paintings number and it will tell you the artist name, style, and it's background. If you are into Egyptian art, their collection is pretty awesome. In ordered to experience the Louvre in it's entirety they say you would have to go there AT LEAST 5 times. The Louvre is the 2nd largest museum with the Vatican museum being third. Can't remember which was the largest. Oh well.</span>

Got some pics.

Ill fill in the blanks later.
