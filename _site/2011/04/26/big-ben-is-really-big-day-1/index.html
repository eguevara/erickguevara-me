		<p>The ride to London was fancy.  We got us some first class sits on the virgin line to London Euston.  Tried to sleep listening to some Corrine Rae but wound up staying up the whole three hour ride.  Too much to take in to sleep.</p>

<p>The scenery was awesome.  Lots of greens and yellow.  There was a strip of land that was completly covered in yellow as far as u can see. Took a picture to post.  The rest was people playing soccer.. lots of livestock .. and small red brick houses.</p>

<p>Arriving at euston.  It was hot as shit.  Apparently London is going through their first warm spell cause everyone was out in shorts and tees.</p>

<p>Something funny coming out of the station was their rendition of the exit sign.   Posted everywhere was "way out". To the point I guess.. leaving little room for confusion.</p>

<p>The hostel was certainly not like Manchester.  This was more like what I expected for hostel.  Shared bathrooms down the halls.  Rooming with six strangers.  Sleeping in a bunk bed. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: We should have paper-rock-scissors for beds because I always got the top bunk. Weak Sauce!</span>  No towels <span style="color:#0000ff;">(Stephanie: you had to buy 1 for 5 euros)</span>... on the fifth floor with no elevator... definitely an experience college prepared me for i guess. At least the shower was hot.  That's all that really matters to me anyway.</p>

<p>As soon as we arrived our mates tell us of a picnic happening at Hyde park.  All I heard is free food.  So we dropped off our bags and off we went to the park.</p>

<p>Cause of the weather everyone was out..The park was jammed.  People tanning ..playing soccer ..we stayed with group for the food for the bit and off we went to explore.</p>

<p>We walked for six hours. We walked through Hyde park and kensington park.. we found some statutes ..Peter pan..princess diane's memorial fountain ..Albert's memorial.. museums .. crossed the serpentine bridge... a couple of gardens with some domesticated squirrels that walked up to you without fear.</p>

<p>Took some really cool pictures.</p>

<p>I'm really glad I decided to bring my fancy shmancy DSLR..  everyone was walking around with one.  I was able to take some cool shots playing around with Depth of Field. I definitely need to invest in a zoom lens with a tripod.  I'm still far from a decent novice photographer, but on learning.</p>

<p>At night we took the district line to Westminster to check out big Ben and the London eye.  Coming out of the station, big Ben just smacks you right on the face.  It looked enormous.  Fully lit with it green and yellow lights. What was also cool was that we got there exactly on top of the hour so the bells going off making it even more nostalgic. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: Fun fact... the bell inside the clock tower is actually Big Ben and not the actual clock itself.</span></p>

<p>London's eye was a beast in itself.  The plan is to ride it later but I don't know man. That shit looked way to high for me.  Crazy how the movie fantastic 4 was filmed here.  Kind of thinking of it.  There's a lot of movies filmed on this very same corner.  Pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is a bike tour and a tour of jack the ripper.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>
