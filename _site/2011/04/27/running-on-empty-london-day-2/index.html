		<p>Our second day in London kicked our ass.  The day started at 7 in the morning and didn't end till our eurostar ride to Paris at 5 in the morning the next day.</p>

<p>We biked for miles all around the Parks on the west side of London.
Later took a ride to the east side of London and all in between. <span style="color:#0000ff;">Stephanie: We used Fat Bike Tours. Dillon was our guide. He was pretty awesome and really knew his history. David, the owner of the London tours, was very helpful in giving us pointers for Paris. He provided maps and showed us what metro stops to get off at. Great people.</span></p>

<p>Too much to say at once but what i can say is that England has some great history.   Starting from their kings to queens to their gruesome way of executing those who betray their country..</p>

<p>You know.. i came to London with a pretty negative impression. Multiple people told me that London smells ..people are rude and stuck up... food is horrible.. i actually I was not even planning on staying here longer than needed but after these two days I'm glad to say that I was wrong.</p>

<p>London was beautiful.  The people were wonderful... the food was decent.. the main attractions were easy to get to by metro.</p>

<p>What I loved most is how unknowingly relative some of this historic places are.  Its amazing how Hollywood can instill experiences and you not even know about it until you experience it first hand. I found myself saying on multiple occasions. "Oohhh this where that movie was from."</p>

<p>Other random take backs..</p>

<p>If you thought America was fascinated with prince William and Kate.. can You imagine how the local folks are? It was bananas here with all the news media..guards and police..all preparing for the big day.  The news media was already there setting up shop..  there was construction everywhere trying to clean up and get the location ready. Pretty crazy.. glad ill be long gone by then..</p>

<p>So there's a section near the palace that has a huge rat and mouse problem..  did you know that England went as far as to honor a cat with the title of chief cat to help mitigate the infestation..  pretty funny that all I got out of that talk was this cat story.  Anyway.. the cat made London news last week for catching his first mouse.</p>

<p>Living in Arizona for close to 10 years it was sad not to know that the original London bridge now resides in Arizona.. who knew?</p>

<p>Btw.  I've seen better looking bridges in Camden NJ than the London bridge.  Very plain...  nothing really spectacular to look at.  Much more prefer the tower bridge with is a walking distance from the London bridge.</p>

<p>To summarize.  London was fabulous.  We walked..we rode.  We ate.. we did all u can possibility squeeze into two days time.</p>

<p>Next is Paris..</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Fun lingo facts: Cheers means thank you, Lovely means awesome or cool, Way out means exit, fancy means you need something... like I fancy a blow dryer, and Toilet means restroom (they are so straight to the point here).</span></p>
