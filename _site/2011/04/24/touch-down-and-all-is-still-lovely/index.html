		<p>Hours later and we finally arrived at London airport.  The flight was as good as any nine hour flight can be.  </p>


<p>Got to watch the fighter.  Pretty good movie.  I still think marky mark is one of the worst actors.  Can't understand how he continues to get good roles. Now christian bale on the other hand was amazing. He played a crackhead almost to perfection. Kinda scary how good he played that role. </p>


<p>Tried to watch tourist but fell asleep.   Tried to watch tron but fell asleep again.  Finally towards the end of the flight I was able to stay up to watch stand by me the classic.</p>


<p>So London. The people at the checkin were kinda of jerky.  Had an attitude cause I didn't have my address of the hostel. Oo well didn't pay any mind. Actually took my time and annoyed him more.</p>


<p>Prople here are funny..  The way they dress, talk, walk,their hair, their makeup ... Etc. I guess I probably seem just as odd to them.  I found myself staring often trying to make sense and trying to understand their way. To me its just interesting.. I just love observing people's behavior and listening to how the speak.</p>


<p>Something i find funny is how they use the word lovely.. the flight attendant use it like three times when picking up my food.  The best I can relate it to is how I use the word cool.. or awesome. Do you have any garbage?.. no.. cool/lovely.  Can I see ur boarding pass??  Lovely.</p>


<p>Funny to listen I guess.</p>


<p>Lesson learned.  Not all countries here use the euro.  That's what I thought initially before getting to Manchester.  Still using the pound and pence here.   I guess my monopoly money will have to wait till I get to Paris.</p>


<p>Its great to speak Spanish.  So the first two people we meet spoke Spanish to us.  The first lady was soon nice. Guided us to train station, our hostel and gave us a mini tour.  Such a nice lady.  The second person was the front desk person in our hostel.  Pretty cool cat.  And hooked us up with a pretty decent room.</p>


<p>Ok.  I'm starting to blab.<br>
Plus I need to get rest for tomorrows big day at old trafford.  Manchester. Vs Everton.</p>


<p>In short.. I went to the grocery store and left with bread..peanut butter and jelly,  had one too many drinks...took many pictures<br>
. Got lost and Listened to marcos and tried a chicken kabab.. freaking delicious.</p>


<p>Till tomorrow.</p>
